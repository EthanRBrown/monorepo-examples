# Monorepo Examples

Because monorepos have been an endless source of consternation to me, I thought I'd lay down some examples so I don't have to tear my hair out every time.

# "Vanilla" Examples

"Vanilla" examples don't use any tooling beyond the package manager (i.e. they don't use Lerna, Bit, etc).
